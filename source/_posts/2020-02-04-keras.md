##### 下载mnist数据集，网络失败的问题

Keras file is located into a new path in Google Cloud Storage (Before it was in AWS S3)：

```py
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz
```

When using:

```
tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
```

You can pass a `path` parameter.

`load_data()` will call `get_file()` which takes as parameter `fname`, if path is a full path and file exists, it will not be downloaded.

Example:

```py
# gsutil cp gs://tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz /tmp/data/mnist.npz
# python3
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> path = '/tmp/data/mnist.npz'
>>> (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(path)
>>> len(train_images)
>>> 60000
```
