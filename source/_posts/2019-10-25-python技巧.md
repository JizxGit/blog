#### 多字段排序

其实就是将要排序的字段组成一个元组

```python
L = [(12, 12), (34, 13), (32, 15), (12, 24), (32, 64), (32, 11)]
L.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1])) 
```



#### 显示字符串原始内容，不进行转义

```python
s=["s\nsdf\r","s\n","d\r\n","sdf\n\r"]
for i in s:
    print repr(i)
```



#### 读取多个文件

```python
with open('file1') as f1, open('file2') as f2, open('file3') as f3:
    for i in f1:
        j = f2.readline()
        k = f3.readline()
        print(i,j,k)
```



还有一种优雅一点的写法（已过时）：

```python
from contextlib import nested

with nested(open('file1'), open('file2'), open('file3')) as (f1,f2,f3):
    for i in f1:
        j = f2.readline()
        k = f3.readline()
        print(i,j,k)
```





#### readline报错 Unicode error 

The default for errors is 'strict', meaning that encoding errors raise a UnicodeError. Other possible values are 'ignore', 'replace', 'xmlcharrefreplace', 'backslashreplace' and any other name registered via codecs.register_error(), see section Error Handlers. For a list of possible encodings, see section Standard Encodings.

In Python 3, pass an appropriate `errors=` value (such as `errors=ignore` or `errors=replace`) on creating your file object (presuming it to be a subclass of `io.TextIOWrapper` -- and if it isn't, consider wrapping it in one!); also, consider passing a more likely encoding than `charmap` (when you aren't sure, `utf-8` is always a good place to start).

For instance:

```py
f = open('misc-notes.txt', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore')
```

------

In Python 2, the `read()` operation simply returns bytes; the trick, then, is decoding them to get them into a string (if you do, in fact, want characters as opposed to bytes). If you don't have a better guess for their real encoding:

```py
your_string.decode('utf-8', 'replace')
```

...to replace unhandled characters, or

```py
your_string.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
```

to simply ignore them.
